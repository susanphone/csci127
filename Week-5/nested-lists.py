#add a pure function to the nested list that calculates
#and returns the total population of the info passed 
#into it.Print the value after the function returns it.

# Modify the populations variable to include information 
# about whether each state is landlocked. Consider a 
# landlocked state to be one that does not touch the 
# Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico.

# Modify the program to also calculate and print the
# percentage of the population in the 10 most populated 
# states that live in a landlocked state.
