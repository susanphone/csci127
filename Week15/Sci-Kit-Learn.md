# Machine Learning!
## Program the computer to analyze data, and to suggest conclusions

# Supervised vs Unsupervised
## Supervised Learning:
    Handwriting Analysis
    Decision Tree(a good guesser)
    SVM: Support vestor machine
        "Black Box"
        clf = svm.SVC(gamma=0.001, C=100)
            variable = clf(classifier)
            class = svm
            method = SVC
            arguments = gamma, C
        

### Classification
### Regression



## Unsupervised Learning:
### Clustering
### Density Estimation
### Visualization
