George Boole (1777-1855)

True : 1    on      high voltage    yes     do it

False: 0    off     low voltage     no      don't do it

### Boolean Functions:


    It is common to give boolean functions
    names that sound like yes/no questions. 
    Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:

### Boolean value:   
    True or False

### Boolean Expression:
    == equality
    Comparison operators:
        x != y               # x is not equal to y
        x > y                # x is greater than y
        x < y                # x is less than y
        x >= y               # x is greater than or equal to y
        x <= y               # x is less than or equal to y

### Logical operators:
    and, or, not

# Precendence of operators:
    7(high)     exponent            **

    6           multiplication      *,/,//,%

    5           addition            +,-

    4           relational          ==,!=,<=,>=,>,<

    3           logical             not

    2           logical             and

    1(low)      logical             or

### Binary Conditions:
    If...
    Else...

### Urnary Conditions: and/or
    If...
    Print...
Ternary Operators: not talked about in class

### Nested Conditions:
    If...
    Else...:
        If...
        Else...
### Chained Conditions:
    If...
