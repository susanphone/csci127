# Grading - 10 points

    2 points - A dataframe is created using the read_csv method.
    
    1 points - The labels for the x-axis and y-axis are determined by information in the dataframe. Thus, any csv file that has the same format as the two files being used in lab would display correctly.
    
    1 points - The title for the graph is determined by the information in the string parameter file_name that comes before the ".csv" file extension.
    
    1 point - the dataframe values to be plotted are sorted in descending order 
    
    5 points - The dataframe plot method uses each of the following arguments correctly such that the sample graphs are matched exactly: title, legend, x, y, and kind. 1 point each.
