# Data Types:
        A set of values. The type of a value determines how it can be used in expressions. So far, the types you have seen are integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), and strings (str).
### String or str()
        a string of characters within quotation marks.
### Integeror int()
        integers don't have any decimals nor do they have commas.
### Float or float()
        floats are numbers that have a decimal and must contain a decimal.
# Variable and Assignment Statements:
### Variable: Name that refers to an  object or value.  
    Names are like sticky notes. 
### Assignments: Value of the name
        name = value
        to assign something use:  =
        to create equality use:  ==
### Statement:
        Instruction that the Python interpreter can execute.
        Includes: while, for, if, and import
### Reassigning:
        Give a new value to an existing variable.
        example: 
                a = 5
                b = a
                therefore b = 5
### Updating:
        the new value of a variable depends on the old value.
        use increment(bumping) to add ( + 1)
        use decrement to subtract ( - 1)
