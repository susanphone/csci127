# Functions
### What is a function?
    a function is a named sequence of statements that belong together. Their primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the solution to the problem.
### Parameters: 
a parameter is a variable listed inside the parentheses that is passed into a function.
### Fruitful vs Non-fruitful:
    Fruitful: 
        function that returns a value
    Non-fruitful:
        function does not return a value
### global vs local variables:
    global: 
        defined outside of a function and is defined for the whole program.
    local:  
        only defined within a function and not outside the function
## Types of Functions and Role:

    print()
    input()
    range()
    return()
    
### iteration:
    for loop
        for loop has a set amount of repeats
    while loop
        while loop will only end when the base case is met
### Boolean Function:
    It is common to give boolean functions
    names that sound like yes/no questions. 
    Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:
        True or False
        and, or, not
        Comparison operators:
        x != y               # x is not equal to y
        x > y                # x is greater than y
        x < y                # x is less than y
        x >= y               # x is greater than or equal to y
        x <= y               # x is less than or equal to y
#### Conditions:
    binary:  if... else...
    urnary:  if... print(or return)...
    nested:  if... else...
                if... else...
    chained: if... elif... else...

#### Truth Tables:
And
    if there is a false, then it is false
Or
    if there is a true, then it is true
Not
    if not true, then it is false.
