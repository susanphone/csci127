# Dictionaries (Part 1):
### Lists are like tuples except tuples are not mutable.
### Strings are a collection of characters.
### Strings can be indexed by the character in the string.
### Tuples can be indexed the same way.
### String and tuples are not mutable.
## This is Sequential!
## Dictionaries are a collection of data with key and pair
    DICT from letters in the alphabet:
    Key : Value         Key : Value
    D   :   4           I   :   9
    I   :   9           D   :   4
    C   :   3           T   :   20
    T   :   20          C   :   3
## Values can be any object
    List
    Tutle
    Strings
    Integers
    Floats
    Tuples
## Dictionaries use {}
