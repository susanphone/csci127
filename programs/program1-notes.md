# Program One Notes:

## How to calculate parts:
    Tax
        (totalcost x tax) + totalcost
    
    Average cost per item
        add items / total number of items

    Total items
        number of entries
            total items per entry added together

# Concepts:
#### Data types: 
    Strings, Integers, and Floats
#### Functions: 
Defitions, 
#### Selections: 
If and else, nested, operations, logical, conditional statements
#### Iterations: 
Repeated execution of a sequence of statements
    
    For-loops, while-loops
#use while-loop for number of entries?
    
    3n+1 sequence
#use to input items per entry?
#### Newtons Squareroot: 
    def newtonSqrt(n, howmany):
(use newtonSqrt for average cost per item?)
#### Sentinal Values

#### Accumulator Design Pattern
Add to total cost:
        
        count = 0
        count = count + 1
        count += 1
        count would be 1, then 2,etc.
