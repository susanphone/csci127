Turtle is the name of the Module
    Turtle type         turtle.Turtle()
    Screen type         turtle.Screen()
Canvas is the window to draw on.
Turtle begins by facing EAST unless directions specify otherwise.
Window Background Color     wn.bgcolor
Turtle's assigned name      alex = turtle.Turtle()
Color of turtle             alex.color("blue)
Size of pen                 alex.pensize(3)
Exit window                 wn.exitonclick()
Loop Variable Example:
    for name in ["Joe", "Amy", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
    print("Hi", name, "Please come to my party on Saturday!")

Control flow until now has been strictly top to bottom, one statement at a time. 
We call this type of control sequential. In Python flow is sequential as long as
successive statements are indented the same amount. 
The for statement introduces indented sub-statements after the 
for-loop heading.
For-Loop:
    for i in range(4):
        turtle.right(90)
        turtle.forward(20)
    for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
        alex.color(aColor)     This changes the color of each line.
        alex.forward(50)
        alex.left(90)
Count from 0
    print(list(range(4)))           prints 0,1,2,3
    print(list(range(1,5)))         prints 1,2,3,4
    print(list(range(1,5 + 1)))     prints 1,2,3,4,5
    print(list(range(0, 10, 2)))    prints 0,2,4,6,8
    print(list(range(5, 0, -1)))    prints 5,4,3,2,1
Direction of Turtle 
    Up          turtle.up()- lifts turtle
    Down        turtle.down()- drops turtle
    Shape       turtle.shape()- designates a specific shape
        arrow, blank, circle, classic, square, triangle, turtle
    Speed       turtle.speed(0)- (0-10)
    Stamp       turtle.stamp()- stamps the shape of the turtle

Method      Parameters           Description

Turtle          None             Creates and returns a new turtle object

forward         distance         Moves the turtle forward

backward        distance         Moves the turle backward

right           angle            Turns the turtle clockwise

left            angle            Turns the turtle counter clockwise

up              None             Picks up the turtles tail

down            None             Puts down the turtles tail

color           color name       Changes the color of the turtle’s tail

fillcolor       color name       Changes the color of the turtle will use to fill a polygon

heading         None             Returns the current heading

position        None             Returns the current position

goto            x,y              Move the turtle to position x,y

begin_fill      None             Remember the starting point for a filled polygon

end_fill        None             Close the polygon and fill with the current fill color

dot             None	         Leave a dot at the current position

stamp	        None	         Leaves an impression of a turtle shape at the current location

shape           shape name       Should be ‘arrow’, ‘classic’, ‘turtle’, ‘circle’ or ‘square’


attribute
    Some state or value that belongs to a particular object. For example, tess has a color.

canvas
    A surface within a window where drawing takes place.

control flow
    See flow of execution in the next chapter.

for loop
    A statement in Python for convenient repetition of statements in the body of the loop.

instance
    An object that belongs to a class. tess and alex are different instances of the class Turtle

invoke
    An object has methods. We use the verb invoke to mean activate the method. 
    Invoking a method is done by putting parentheses after the method name, with some possible arguments. 
    So wn.exitonclick() is an invocation of the exitonclick method.

iteration
    A basic building block for algorithms (programs). It allows steps to be repeated. 
    Sometimes called looping.

loop body
    Any number of statements nested inside a loop. 
    The nesting is indicated by the fact that the statements are indented under the for loop statement.

loop variable
    A variable used as part of a for loop. It is assigned a different value on each iteration of the loop, 
    and is used as part of the terminating condition of the loop, when it can no longer get a further value.

method
    A function that is attached to an object. Invoking or activating the method causes the object to respond in some way,
    e.g. forward is the method when we say tess.forward(100).

module
    A file containing Python definitions and statements intended for use in other Python programs. 
    The contents of a module are made available to the other program by using the import statement.

object
    A “thing” to which a variable can refer. This could be a screen window, or one of the turtles you have created.

range
    A built-in function in Python for generating sequences of integers. 
    It is especially useful when we need to write a for loop that executes a fixed number of times.

sequential
    The default behavior of a program. Step by step processing of algorithm.

state
    The collection of attribute values that a specific data object maintains.

terminating condition
    A condition that occurs which causes a loop to stop repeating its body. 
    In the for loops we saw in this chapter, the terminating condition has been when there are no 
    more elements to assign to the loop variable.

turtle
    A data object used to create pictures (known as turtle graphics).
