# Working with Data Files:

### Opening a file:
    To read a file:
        open(filename, "r")
    To write to a file:
        open(filename, "w")
    To close a file: 
        filevariable.close()

## Absolute vs. Relative File Paths
### Absolute file path:
    The name of a file that includes a path to the file from the root directory of a file system. An absolute file path always starts with a /.
    /Users/yourname/...
### Relative file path:
     The name of a file that includes a path to the file from the current working directory of a program. An relative file path never starts with a /.
     .../mydata/data.txt
